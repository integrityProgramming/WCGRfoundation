    <p class="aboutUsPage">The Windy City Guide Right Foundation was established in November 2020, by alumni members of the Theta Zeta Chapter of the Kappa Alpha Psi, Fraternity Incorporated who attended and graduated from Chicago State University and the University of Illinois, at Chicago. The purpose for the formation of this foundation is to provide financial assistance to inner city male youths who would not otherwise be able to pursue higher level academic opportunities. This foundation is organized exclusively for charitable, literary, scientific and educational purposes within the guidelines of the Internal Revenue Code. </p>
  <!--<p>The Foundation was established by alumni brothers that attended the university and were initiated into the Theta Zeta Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated along with other chapters after graduation. The foundation is operated by a volunteer board. </p>
    <p>Our focus is to bring tangible resources to the university for the enhancement of its students while in school and for their careers once they graduate. Our mission is to be a viable entity and ensure that we play a role in preparing today’s young minds for tomorrow.</p> -->
